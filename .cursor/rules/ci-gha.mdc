# Rust WebAssembly CI/CD Workflow

## Core Principles
- Use `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for efficient Rust dependency caching
- Implement composite actions for reusable code setup
- Share build artifacts between jobs to avoid duplicate work
- Optimize cache configuration for maximum build speed
- Refer to git branch: `master`
